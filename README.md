# Free-Grammarly-Premium-Suggestions
## Description:

Ever hated the fact that Grammarly only gives you 3 free premium suggestions a day? Well, I have. In fact, the first word of this description has a yellow underline. This code is a simple bookmarklet that allows you to get the suggestion for free.

## How to use:

Simply click the bookmarklet and quickly hover your mouse over the yellow underline so that the small popup with the sticky note appears. Do it quickly though, as you only have about 2 seconds to do it. After that, a page will open with a green background with the text and also a small copy to clipboard button. If there is no green background, then either you hovered over the yellow underline too late or the website you're using just isn't compatible. One website that I have tested on and works is Online Notepad: https://onlinenotepad.org/notepad.
